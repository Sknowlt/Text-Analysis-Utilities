# Text Analysis Tools

## Dev Notes
This documents serves to dicuss tasks that I'd like to accomplish within this tool. There is no specific focus as it is only meant to grow as I discover new techniques to apply when analyzing text for cryptanalysis purposes and for general usage.



### Plaintext Analysis
Plaintext - plaintext is text that has no obfuscation or encryption applied.

Want to analyze plaintext for:
- IoC - DONE
- Letter Frequency Analysis - DONE
- Word Frequency Analysis
- Encoding
- Language
- Digrams
- Trigrams

### Ciphertext Analysis
Ciphertext - Ciphertext in the opposite of plaintext. It is plaintext that is run through a cipher or is encrypted/obsfucated in some way.

Want to analyze ciphertext for:
- IoC - DONE
- Letter Frequency Analysis - DONE
- Encoding
- Language 
- Digrams
- Trigrams
